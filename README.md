## DocuScope and Part-of-Speech tagging with spaCy

This application is designed for the analysis of small corpora assisted by part-of-speech and rhetorical tagging.

With the application users can:

1. process small corpora
2. create frequency tables of words, phrases, and tags
3. calculate associations around node words
4. generate key word in context (KWIC) tables
5. compare corpora or sub-corpora
6. explore single texts
7. practice advanced plotting


## Using as Template

This repository can be used as a template for creating custom deployments:

- **Desktop Version**: Use the "Use this template" button to create a desktop application with Tauri
- **Custom Deployments**: Adapt for institutional or research-specific needs
- **Educational Versions**: Create modified versions for classroom use

See `TEMPLATE_USAGE.md` for detailed instructions on using this repository as a template.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Quick Setup

When running locally:

- [ ] Clone this repository.
- [ ] Create a virtual environment.
- [ ] Navigate to the directory.
- [ ] Install the requirements.
- [ ] Set `desktop_mode` to `True`.

Then run:

```bash
streamlit run webapp/index.py
```

## Features

This application provides a comprehensive suite of tools for corpus analysis:

- **Corpus Processing**: Upload and process small to medium-sized text corpora
- **Dual Tagging**: Combines part-of-speech tagging with DocuScope rhetorical analysis
- **Frequency Analysis**: Generate detailed frequency tables for words, phrases, and rhetorical tags
- **Collocation Analysis**: Calculate statistical associations around target words
- **KWIC Tables**: Create keyword-in-context concordances for detailed text examination
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare different corpora or sub-sections of the same corpus
- **Single Document Explorer**: In-depth analysis of individual texts
- **Advanced Visualization**: Interactive plotting tools for data exploration
- **Dual Mode Operation**: 
  - **Enterprise Mode**: Full-featured deployment for institutional use
  - **Desktop Mode**: Streamlined interface for individual researchers

## Configuration

The application behavior is controlled through the `webapp/config/options.toml` file. Key configuration options include:

- `desktop_mode`: Enables/disables simplified interface (default: `false`)
- Language validation settings
- File size limits
- AI integration controls
- Database logging options

Refer to the configuration files in `webapp/config/` for detailed customization options.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Corpus Analysis

1. Load your corpus using the "Manage Corpora" page
2. Generate frequency tables for initial exploration
3. Use KWIC tables to examine specific terms in context
4. Create visualizations to identify patterns

### Comparative Studies

1. Upload multiple corpora or define sub-corpora
2. Use "Compare Corpora" tools to identify statistical differences
3. Generate comparative visualizations
4. Export results for further analysis
