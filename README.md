## About DocuScope CA Desktop

DocuScope CA Desktop is a standalone desktop application for corpus analysis and concordancing, combining part-of-speech tagging with DocuScope rhetorical analysis.

With the desktop application users can:

1. process small to medium-sized corpora
2. create frequency tables of words, phrases, and tags
3. calculate associations around node words
4. generate key word in context (KWIC) tables
5. compare corpora or sub-corpora
6. explore single texts
7. practice advanced plotting

## Installation

### System Requirements

- **Windows**: Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- **macOS**: macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later

- Local file processing without external dependencies
- Optimized performance for desktop environments

## Usage Examples

### Basic Corpus Analysis

1. Launch DocuScope CA Desktop
2. Load your corpus using the "Manage Corpora" page
3. Generate frequency tables for initial exploration
4. Use KWIC tables to examine specific terms in context
5. Create visualizations to identify patterns

### Comparative Studies

1. Upload multiple corpora or define sub-corpora
2. Use "Compare Corpora" tools to identify statistical differences
3. Generate comparative visualizations
4. Export results for further analysis

## Development

### Building from Source
